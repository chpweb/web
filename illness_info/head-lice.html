		<h2>Head Lice (Pediculosis humanus capitis)</h2>
		<hr />
		<div class="content">
		  <p>Finding out your child has lice can be a stressful time, but it is manageable.  The treatments are time consuming but will be successful.</p>
      		  <p>The first thing to know its that lice are tiny insects which can infest different parts of the body â€“ the head, the body, and the pubic area.  Head lice are by far the most common type of lice in children.  They are found worldwide; in the United States, infestation is most common among preschool children and children attending daycare.   African-American children are less likely to be infested by head lice than children of other races; this is thought to be due to the claws of lice being better adapted to the hair texture of other races.</p>
		  <h3>General Information</h3>
		  <p>Adult head lice are ~2-3 mm in length.  They infest the head and neck, and attach eggs to the bases of hair shafts.  <b>Head lice cannot move by jumping or flying, only by crawling.</b>  Animals play no role in transmission, only close human-to-human contact.  That means <b>your pets at home CANNOT carry or spread human lice.</b> Head lice feed on human blood several times a day and live close to the scalp.  However, they are not known to spread disease.  Personal hygiene or cleanliness of the home have nothing to do with getting head lice. The opposite in fact has been known to be true and we will discuss that more below.</p>
		  <h3>Life Cycle of Head Lice</h3>
		  <p><img src="/img/lice-penny.jpg" style="float:right; margin: -20px 0 10px 10px; width: 200px" /> Head lice have 3 stages: egg (nit), nymph, and adult.</p>
		  <ul>
		    <li><b>Nits</b> are yellowish/whitish, and are laid at the base of the hair shaft.  They take about 8-9 days to hatch. </li>
		    <li>A <b>nymph</b> is an immature louse that hatches from the egg; it matures into an adult louse in 9-12 days. </li>
		    <li>The fully grown <b>adult louse</b> is about the size of a sesame seed.  It must feed on blood in order to survive; it can live for 30 days on the scalp but dies within a day or two after falling off the scalp.</li>
		  </ul>
		  <h3>Signs of Symptoms of Lice</h3>
		  <ul>
		    <li>Tickling sensation in hair</li>
		    <li>Itching, caused by an allergic reaction to the head louse (commonly behind the ears and the base of neck)</li>
		    <li>Difficulty sleeping (lice are most active in the dark)</li>
		    <li>Sores on the scalp due to scratching</li>
		  </ul>
		  <h3>How do children get lice?</h3>
		  <p>Children are infested most commonly through head-to-head contact with an already infected person.  This can occur during sports activities, playground, slumber parties, camps, etc. Although uncommon, lice can spread through shared clothing or items (hats, combs, sharing a pillow, stuffed animals, etc).  Lice prefer clean hair.  If there is a known outbreak in your school we recommend a few things at home.  Keep your childs hair pulled back as much as possible in ponytails or braids.  Also, use some product in your childs hair, such as hairspray or hair gel.</p>
		  <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
		  <p>Diagnosis is made by finding a live nymph or an adult louse on the scalp.  They can often be difficult to find, and using a fine-tooth comb and magnifying lens can be helpful.  If nits are found more than 1/4 inch from the base of the hair shafts, they are likely already hatched or dead.</p>
		  <h3>What should you do if your child has lice?</h3>
		  <ul>
		    <li>Treatment is recommended for persons diagnosed with active infestation (see treatment section below).</li>
		    <li>All household members and any other persons sharing close contact with your child should be checked and then treated if necessary.</li>
		    <li>Besides using the medication for treatment, all hats, scarves, clothing, pillowcases, bedding, and towels used by your child 2 days prior should be washed in hot water and dried.  <b>Lice and eggs are killed by exposure of more than 5 minutes to temperatures greater than 128.3 degrees Fahrenheit.</b></li>
		    <li>Items that cannot be washed should be dry-cleaned or sealed in plastic bags for 2 weeks.</li>
		    <li>Vacuum all carpeted areas and sweep/mop all floor surfaces.  <b>Remember, head lice cannot survive for more than 1 or 2 days after falling off the scalp.</b>  The lice bug needs a blood supply to survive. Nits however can live off the head 7-10 days. You will want to be careful with the nit removal so they are disposed of properly.</li>
		    <li>Once your child has been treated, he/she may return to school.</li>
		  </ul>
		  <h3>Treatment</h3>
		  <ul>
		    <li>We recommend starting with an over-the-counter lice medication such as <b>Nix</b> or <b>Rid</b>.  Apply the medication as instructed in the box.  Do NOT use any  conditioners prior to using the medication. The hair does not need to be clean before application.</li>
		    <li>Also, the hair should not be rewashed for 1-2 days after the lice medicine is removed.</li>
		    <li>A fine-toothed nit comb should be used to comb out any dead or live lice from the hair.  These combs are usually included in the box with the medication.</li>
		    <li>You may take your child to <b>Shiny Strands</b>, a hair salon dedicated to treatment of lice.  <a href="http://www.shinystrands.com">www.shinystrands.com</a></li>
		    <li>If over the counter treatment has not worked for your child, please call us for prescription strength medication.</li>
		    <li>Check the hair every 2-3 days after the treatment.  Sometimes, the treatment needs to be repeated in 7-9 days, especially if using over the counter products.</li>
