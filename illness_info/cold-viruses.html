		<h2>Cold Viruses</h2>
		<hr />
		<div class="content">
			<p><p><b>The common cold</b> is a group of symptoms caused by a number of different
viruses. There are hundreds of different viruses responsible for the common cold.
In most cases, a specific virus causes a person to be ill only once, after which they
are immune to that virus. However, because there are so many cold viruses,
people may have multiple colds each year.</p>

<p>Children under six years average six to eight colds per year with symptoms lasting
an average of 14 days. Young children in daycare appear to suffer from more colds
than children cared for at home, and often are sick for most of the cough and cold
season. However, when daycare children enter primary school, they catch fewer
colds, presumably because they are already immune to a larger number.</p>

<h4>Transmission</h4>
<p>Colds are transmitted from person-to-person, either by direct
contact or by contact with the virus in the environment. Colds are most contagious
during the first two to four days. Some cold viruses can live on surfaces (such as
countertops, door handles, or toys) for several days, and some can be spread
when droplets containing viral particles are exhaled into the air by breathing,
coughing, or sneezing, and then inhaled by another. Cold viruses are not usually
spread through saliva.</p>

<h3>Common Cold Symptoms</h3>
<p>The symptoms of a cold usually begin one to two
days after exposure. In children, nasal congestion is the most prominent symptom.
Children can also have clear, yellow, or green-colored nasal discharge. Fever
(&gt;100.4º F) is common during the first three days of the illness. Other symptoms
may include sore throat, cough, irritability, difficulty sleeping, decreased appetite,
and swollen lymph nodes. The symptoms of a cold are usually worst during the first
10 days. However, some children continue to have a runny nose, congestion, and a
cough beyond 10 days. In addition, it is not unusual for a child to develop a second
cold as the symptoms of the first cold are resolving; this can make it seem as if the
child has a single cold that lasts for weeks or even months, especially during the fall
and winter. This is not a cause for concern, unless the child has any of the more
serious symptoms, discussed below.</p>

<h3>Coughs</h3>
<p>Coughing is your body's way of clearing secretions and mucus, to
keep it from 'settling' in your lungs. It serves a very useful purpose, so coughs
should not be suppressed. Cough medicine is ineffective, anyway, so another
reason to save your money and avoid buying cough medicine! Parents often
notice that they feel 'congestion' rattling, or vibrating in their child's chest when he
has a cold. The entire airway is connected from the nose to the lungs, and noise
from congestion in the nose and sinuses travels all the way down into the chest,
and thus seems as though it is originating in the chest. The only way to tell
whether the congestion is truly in the lungs or simply being transmitted from the
nose and sinuses is for a doctor to listen with a stethoscope. If your child is
coughing mildly and/or infrequently with a cold virus, it is likely simply secondary to
the cold. If your child's cough is persistent and bothersome, perhaps affecting his
sleep, and/or if he seems to be breathing hard or fast when you observe his chest,
the cough could signify a process in the lungs. If this is the case, please contact our
office.</p>

<h3>Common Cold Complications</h3>
<p>Most children who have colds do not
develop complications. However, parents should be aware of the signs and
symptoms of potential complications.</p>

<h4>Ear infection</h4>
<p>If a child develops a fever (&gt;100.4º F) after the first
three days of cold symptoms, an ear infection may be to blame. Other symptoms
of an ear infection include ear pain, irritability, difficulty sleeping or lying flat, and
refusal to drink from a bottle.</p>

<h4>Sinusitis</h4>
<p>Children who have nasal congestion that does not improve over the
course of 14 days may have a bacterial sinus infection. Doctors can't see a patients
sinuses without an X-RAY, so they have to rely on symptoms to diagnose a sinus
infection. If your child has had cold symptoms for over 2 weeks and other
bothersome symptoms such as cough, decreased appetite, poor sleep, fatigue, and/
or fevers, it is reasonable to start antibiotics for a presumed sinus infection.</p>

<h4>Pneumonia</h4>
<p>Children who develop a fever after the first three days of cold
symptoms may have bacterial pneumonia, especially if the child also has a
persistent or deep cough, and/or is breathing rapidly.</p>

<h4>Wheezing</h4>
<p>Children who are prone to wheezing or asthma symptoms often are
triggered by viral respiratory infections. A deep or persistent cough, chest
tightness or difficulty breathing my signify that your child has developed wheezing.</p>

<h3>Common Cold Treatment</h3>
<p>Antihistamines, decongestants, cough medicines, and expectorants, alone and in
combinations, are all marketed for the symptoms of a cold. However, there have
been few clinical trials of these products in infants and children, and there are no
studies that demonstrate any benefit in infants or children.</p>
<p>The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory panel has
recommended against the use of these medications in children younger than six.
This includes prescription cough medicines. We agree with this recommendation
because these medications are not proven to be effective and have the potential to
cause dangerous side effects. For children older than 6 years, cold medications may
have fewer risks; however, there is still no proven benefit.</p>

<h4>Symptomatic Treatment</h4>
<p><b>Fever reducers: Tylenol (acetaminophen)</b> can be giving to a child over 2
months who is uncomfortable because of fever during the first few days of a cold.
<b>Ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil)</b> can be given to children greater than six months of
age. <b>Aspirin should not be given to any child under age 18 years.</b> There is no
benefit of these medications if the child is comfortable and does not have a fever
greater than 100.4º F (38º C), and it is not necessary for all children to be treated
for fever. For instance, we don't recommend waking a peacefully sleeping child
just to give a fever reducer.</p>
<p><b>Humidified air</b> can improve symptoms of nasal congestion and runny nose. For
infants, parents can try saline nose drops to loosen the mucus, followed by bulb
suction. It is helpful to occlude the opposite nostril for adequate suction.</p>
<p><b>Fluids:</b> Parents should encourage their child to drink an adequate amount of fluids.
Children often have a reduced appetite during a cold, and may eat less than usual.
Don’t worry as long as they are staying hydrated and urinating at least 4-6 times
per day. Milk, water or other clear fluids are appropriate choices for children over
one. Breast milk, formula or Pedialyte are appropriate for young infants, and
infants older than 6 months can have juices as well.</p>
<p><b>Herbal and alternative treatments</b> — A number of alternative products,
including zinc, vitamin C, and herbal products such as echinacea, are advertised to
treat or prevent the common cold. None of these treatments has been proven to be
effective in clinical trials; their use is not recommended.</p>

<h3>When to call the office</h3>
<h4>Immediately</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Refusal to drink anything for a prolonged period, resulting in decreased
urination (no urination for >6 hours in infants, >8 hours in children over one
year, while awake).</li>
    <li>Behavior changes, including irritability or difficulty arousing. Many children
sleep more when they are sick, but they should be easily aroused from sleep,
without seeming confused or acting bizarrely.</li>
    <li>Fast, hard, or labored breathing</li>
</ul>

<h4>During Normal Office Hours</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Persistent coughing</li>
    <li>Fever greater than 100.4 for more than 72 hours (3 days)</li>
    <li>Nasal congestion does not improve or worsens over the course of 14 days</li>
    <li>The eyes become red or develop yellow discharge</li>
    <li>There are signs or symptoms of an ear infection (pain, ear pulling, fussiness,
bottle refusal or difficulty lying flat)</li>
</ul></p>
