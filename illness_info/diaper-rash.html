		<h2>Diaper Rash</h2>

			<p><h3>What is Diaper Rash?</h3>
      <p>A diaper rash is any rash in the area of skin covered by the diaper. Almost all babies will develop a diaper rash at some point in time.  Diaper rashes are especially common in children with fair or sensitive skin.  In mild cases, the skin may just be reddened.  In other cases, the skin may develop bumpy areas or raw, open sores.</p>

      <h3>What causes a Diaper Rash?</h3>
      <p>When skin stays wet for too long, the layers that protect it start to break down.  When wet skin is rubbed, it also chafes more easily.  Also, when the normal bacteria of the skin is altered such as through the use of antibiotics or overuse of wipes, yeast may overgrow and cause a type of diaper rash.</p>

      <h4>Diaper Rash occurs more often in the following instances:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>As infants get older (mostly between 8 and 10 months of age), especially when they begin to eat solid foods</li>
        <li>In babies who have frequent stools, such as newborns</li>
        <li>When babies are teething</li>
        <li>When babies are or have recently taken antibiotics</li>
        <li>When babies have gastroenteritis (diarrhea)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What can I do to prevent Diaper Rash?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Change diapers promptly, especially after bowel movements</li>
        <li>Do not overuse wipes.  Wipes are only necessary after stools.  Patting the bottom dry after wet diapers is sufficient.  Sometimes using wet paper towels is gentler than baby wipes.</li>
        <li>Do not shake talcum or baby powder onto your baby's bottom.  It can be inhaled by babies when powder particles are dispensed into the air, causing breathing problems.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Home Treatment</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Discontinue wipes until the rash has cleared.  Instead, use wet paper towels if necessary.</li>
        <li>Change diapers frequently.</li>
        <li>Leave the diaper open to air, if possible.</li>
        <li>Apply a thick layer of protective cream such as Desitin, A&amp;D, or Triple Paste to form a protective coating. Do NOT completely remove the cream between diaper changes.  If your infant has stooled, clean the stool and then add more barrier diaper cream.</li>
        <li>Rinse bottom with warm water and pat dry.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>A mixture of medicated baby powder or cornstarch, Aquaphor or Vaseline, and a zinc oxide barrier cream, such as Desitin, can provide relief.</p>
      <p>If the skin is very irritated, soaking in a warm tub with a few tablespoons of baking soda may help.</p>
      <p>If the rash does not respond to the above after 3 days, especially if the rash appears pimply or bumpy, or appears to be spreading, the rash likely is a yeast diaper rash.  Apply an over-the-counter antifungal cream (such as Lotrimin or Lamisil) to the bottom 4 times a day.  Generic Clotrimazole will work as well as the name brands and will be less expensive.  These creams can be found in the athlete's foot section of the store.</p>

      <h3>Call the Doctor if:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The rash is worsening or not clearing after 3 days with the above treatment.</li>
        <li>If weeping sores, crusts or boils develop.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Remember, diaper rash is rarely serious, but it can cause your child discomfort.  The best way to treat diaper rash is to prevent it in the first place.</p></p>
