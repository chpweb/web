			<p><h3>What is Thrush?</h3>
      <p>Thrush is caused by yeast and presents with white patches
      that can coat the inside of the mouth and sometimes
      the tongue. Thrush can cause mild discomfort and is
      easily treated.  Thrush is diagnosed by examination by a doctor.</p>

      <h3>Treatment</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>A prescription antifungal medication called Nystatin is used to treat thrush.
        You will need to give 1 ml to each side of the mouth 4
        times a day, after meals. You should rub the Nystatin
        directly on the affected areas using a cotton swab.
        Keep this up for at least 7 days or until all the
        thrush has been gone for 3 days.</li>
        <li>If you are breastfeeding and your nipples are red and
        sore, you may need to apply the Nystatin to any irritated
        areas on your nipples. (Thrush is no reason to stop
        nursing.)</li>
        <li>Limit pacifier use. Prolonged sucking can irritate the
        lining of the mouth.</li>
        <li>Soak all nipples and pacifiers in water at 130 degrees
        for 20 minutes after each use.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Call the doctor if:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Your baby refuses to eat</li>
        <li>Thrush lasts longer than 10 days</li>
        <li>Fever develops</li>
        <li>Symptoms worsen</li>
      </ul></p>
