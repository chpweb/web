				<h3>Influenza ("Flu") -- including H1N1 "Swine" Flu</h3>
				<hr />
				<div class="content">
					<p><p class="strong">
Children's Health Partners follows the CDCâ€™s (<a href="http://www.cdc.gov">www.cdc.gov</a> or <a href="http://www.flu.gov">www.flu.gov</a>) recommendations for preventing and treating influenza (the "flu")/H1N1 influenza:
</p>

<p>
Most individuals who contract the flu have mild disease and recover without problems; however, certain patients are more likely to have more severe disease or complications from the flu.
</p>
 
<p class="strong">
Children who are considered higher risk for influenza related complications and/or more severe disease should be evaluated in our office if they have influenza symptoms.
</p>
 
<p>
<h6>Influenza symptoms include:</h6>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Fever >101</strong>, cough, sore throat, runny nose or congestion, body aches, headache, chills, fatigue, and sometimes vomiting and diarrhea</li>
    <li>Although it is possible to have the flu and not have a fever, this is very unusual</li>
</ul>
</p>
 
<p>
<h6>Higher risk patients include:</h6>

<ul>
    <li>Toddlers and infants under the age of 2</li>
    <li>Children 2-5 years who appear more ill (high fever >103, fast or labored breathing, dehydration, or listlessness)</li>
    <li>Anyone with chronic lung disease, including asthma</li>
    <li>Anyone with chronic disease, including weakened immune systems and diabetes</li>
</ul>
 </p>

<p>
If your child is in a higher risk group and is determined to have influenza, we will prescribe Tamiflu.  Tamiflu is an antiviral medication that can lessen the duration and severity of the flu.  Tamiflu is most helpful if given within the first 48 hours of illness, although it may be of some benefit even if given later in the disease course.
</p>
 
<p class="strong">
If your child is NOT in a higher risk group, you should care for your child at home, observing for "warning signs" of more severe disease. 
</p>
 
<p>
<h6>Home care for influenza:</h6>

<ul>
    <li>Give Motrin or Tylenol to lesson fever.  Do not give aspirin or aspirin-containing products.  Do not be surprised if Tylenol or Motrin does not completely relieve the fever, although it should bring it down several degrees.</li>
    <li>Encourage your child to drink lots of fluid and monitor for dehydration.</li>
    <li>Stay at home to avoid spreading the disease until 24 hours without fever.</li>
    <li>Cough and cold preparations are of no proven benefit, but can be administered to children over 5 years.  Do not give cold medicine to children under 5 years.</li>
</ul>
</p>
 
<p>
<h6>When to call our office for lower risk patients - "warning signs" of more severe disease:</h6>

<ul>
    <li>Fast or labored breathing</li>
    <li>Bluish skin color</li>
    <li>Dehydration</li>
    <li>Being not easily awakened or aroused, interacting inappropriately</li>
    <li>Irritability and inconsolability (even with being held)</li>
    <li>New fever or worsening cough after symptoms seem to be improving</li>
    <li>Fever that lasts longer than 4 days or flu symptoms longer than 10 days and not improving</li>
</ul>
</p>

 
<p>
<h6>What to do if exposed to seasonal flu/H1N1 flu:</h6>
<ul>
    <li>Monitor for symptoms and follow the recommendations above if your child develops symptoms.</li>
</ul>
</p>
 
<p>
 If you have a very high risk child (moderate-severe asthma, cancer or immune suppression, cerebral palsy or neuromuscular disease) and a household contact or very close contact is diagnosed with flu, please call our office.  These select individuals should receive Tamiflu prophylaxis to prevent or lessen flu symptoms in these patients.
