          <h3>Ill Appointments</h3>
          <p>All CHP patients are seen on a by appointment only basis.</p>
          <p>If your child is ill, we suggest that you call us as early in the day as possible regarding his/her illness. Typically the receptionist will take a message with pertinent information about your child and then have one of our nurses return your
            call.</p>
          <p>The nurses will call you and discuss the illness/condition and determine if your child needs to be seen by a physician or if they can offer you sufficient help and advice over the phone.</p>
          <p>If your child needs to be seen by the physician, the nurse will determine how soon they need to be seen and all efforts will be made to schedule an appointment at that appropriate time.</p>
          <p>If your childâ€™s situation requires emergency care, you will be referred to the Emergency room.  Some minor cuts requiring stitches or adhesive glue can be managed by some of our physicians, so please call the office to speak with a nurse if this is your concern.</p>
          <p>If you need advice regarding behavior, sleep issues, etc. your call will be handled in a similar fashion, with the nurses returning your call after consulting with a physician if necessary.</p>

          <h3>Well Child Care &amp; Immunization Schedules</h3>
          <p>Regular well child check-ups are important to monitor your child's growth and development, as well as discuss important health topics pertinent to your child's age and medical issues. Infants and toddlers are seen at more frequent intervals
            to monitor them closely during this rapid period of change. It is recommended that all older children and adolescents get yearly physicals, preferably in their birthday month.</p>

          <p><small>**Gardasil protects against the human papilloma virus (HPV) that causes cervical cancer and genital warts, as well as many cancers of the mouth and throat.  It is a 2 shot series, starting at age 9 and older.  We routinely start the series at age 11.  The second shot is given 6-12 months after the first. If started after the age of 15, it is a 3 dose series.</small></p>

          <p>AAP recommends ALL children aged 6 months - 18 years receive a flu vaccine.</p>
          <p>It is recommended that all household contacts of infants under age 6 months receive a flu vaccine to protect the young infant.</p>
