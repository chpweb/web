				        <h3>Ill Appointments</h3>
				        <p>All CHP patients are seen on a by appointment only basis.</p>
				        <p>If your child is ill, we suggest that you call us as early in the day as possible regarding his/her illness.  Typically the receptionist will take a message with pertinent information about your child and then have one of our nurses return your call.</p>
				        <p>The nurses will call you and discuss the illness/condition and determine if your child needs to be seen by a physician or if they can offer you sufficient help and advice over the phone.</p>
				        <p>If your child needs to be seen by the physician, appointments are made with the physician who is available at the appropriate time that day.  If all appointment times are already booked, we may offer you an appointment the next day or suggest that you proceed to an urgent care facility.</p>
				        <p>If your childâ€™s situation requires emergency care or stitches you will be referred to the Emergency room.</p>
				        <p>If you need advice regarding behavior, sleep issues, etc. your call will be handled in a similar fashion, with the nurses returning your call after consulting with a physician if necessary.</p>

				        <h3>Well Child Care &amp; Immunization Schedules</h3>
				        <p>Regular well child check-ups are important to monitor your child's growth and development, as well as discuss important health topics pertinent to your child's age and medical issues.  Infants and toddlers are seen at more frequent intervals to monitor them closely during this rapid period of change.  It is recommended that all older children and adolescents get yearly physicals, preferably in their birthday month.</p>
