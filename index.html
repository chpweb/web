          	<h5>Beat the Summer Rush</h5>
          	<p>It is not too early to start planning for the 2015/2016 school year.  Avoid the summer rush for school and sports physicals and make your child's appointment this spring.  We are currently scheduling appointments through May.  School physicals are needed for all students entering kindergarten, 6th and 9th grades.</p>

          		<h5>Update for Flu Shot Availability - 11/29/14</h5>
          		<p>We continue to offer the flu shot for all patients who wish to be vaccinated.  FluMist nasal vaccine is no longer available.  All children under 9 years old who received the flu vaccine for the first time this year should receive a second dose at least 4 weeks after the first dose for maximum effectiveness of the vaccine.</p>

		<h5>Flu Vaccines for 2016-2017 Season - Update 10/2/16</h5>
		<p>For the convenience of our patients, we will be offering several flu vaccine clinics this fall on specific dates in the evenings after regular business hours and select Saturday mornings.  Due to current CDC recommendations, only the injectable flu shot will be offered this season.  We expect to have ample supply of the flu vaccine to administer to all of our patients this fall.</p><p></p>Three additional flu vaccine clinics in late October and early November are now being scheduled for all patients over the age of 6 months.  The dates are Wednesday, November 2nd from 5-8pm, and Saturdays, October 29th and November 5th, from 9am to 12pm.  If your child has an upcoming check-up, they will be able to receive their flu vaccine at their appointment.  For those with infants older than 6 months who have already received their first flu vaccine, you can make an appointment for their booster dose at one of these clinics as long as it has been at least 4 weeks since their first dose.</p>

					Fevers
				</h3>
				<p>A fever is an elevation in body temperature >/= 100.4 degrees. Fevers are very common in children, and are generally not harmful unless they climb above 106 degrees (this level of fever is quite uncommon and generally only seen in the setting of heat stroke). A fever, however, is telling you that your body is reacting to something. In fact, a fever is part of your body's natural way of fighting an infection, and is likely beneficial.  Often, a fever is your first warning sign that your child is becoming ill with a virus. The fever will typically last from 24-72 hours. Within that time, your child will likely develop viral symptoms, most commonly either respiratory symptoms (runny nose, cough, congestion), or gastrointestinal symptoms (vomiting, abdominal pain, and/or diarrhea).</p>
