			important thing we can do to help keep your child healthy.  <strong>Effective June 1st, 2017</strong>, Children's Health Partners is no longer 
			accepting families who do not vaccinate their children.  Please

          	<h5>Beat the Summer Rush</h5>
          	<p>It is not too early to start planning for the 2015/2016 school year.  Avoid the summer rush for school and sports physicals and make your child's appointment this spring.  We are currently scheduling appointments through May.  School physicals are needed for all students entering kindergarten, 6th and 9th grades.</p>

		<h4>Flu Vaccines for 2017-2018 Season</h4>
		<p>For the convenience of our patients, we will be offering several flu vaccine clinics this fall on specific dates in the evenings after regular business hours and select Saturday mornings.  Due to current CDC recommendations, only the injectable flu shot will be offered this season.  We expect to have ample supply of the flu vaccine to administer to all of our patients this fall.</p>
		<p>If your child has an upcoming check-up, they will be able to receive their flu vaccine at their appointment.  For those with infants older than 6 months who have already received their first flu vaccine, you can make an appointment for their booster dose at one of these clinics as long as it has been at least 4 weeks since their first dose.</p>
		<p>A complete list of flu vaccine dates can be found by clicking the link below.</p>

  					Fevers
  				</h3>
  				<p>A fever is an elevation in body temperature >/= 100.4 degrees. Fevers are very common in children, and are generally not harmful unless they climb above 106 degrees (this level of fever is quite uncommon and generally only seen in the setting of heat stroke). A fever, however, is telling you that your body is reacting to something. In fact, a fever is part of your body's natural way of fighting an infection, and is likely beneficial.  Often, a fever is your first warning sign that your child is becoming ill with a virus. The fever will typically last from 24-72 hours. Within that time, your child will likely develop viral symptoms, most commonly either respiratory symptoms (runny nose, cough, congestion), or gastrointestinal symptoms (vomiting, abdominal pain, and/or diarrhea).</p>
