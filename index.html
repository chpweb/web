			<h5>VFC Program no longer available at Children's Health Partners</h5>
			<p>The Vaccine for Children (VFC) program is a federally funded, state administered program that provides free vaccines to eligible children ages 18 and younger. In the past, some of our patients that were under-insured, meaning their medical insurance did not provide full vaccine coverage, were eligible to receive vaccines through the VFC program at our office. Effective January 1st, 2013, changes in the Illinois VFC Program are such that all under-insured children are now eligible to receive VFC vaccine only at Federally Qualified Health Centers, Rural Health Centers, or Local Public Health Departments. Please contact your county's local public health department with any questions.</p>

					Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease (Coxsackie Virus)
				</h3>
				<p>Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease is a self-limited viral infection caused by the coxsackie A-16 virus.  Fever is often the first symptom and may be high (103-105 degrees).  The hallmark of the disease is mouth and throat pain. Painful mouth and throat ulcers on a bright red base develop 2-4 days into the illness. The ulcers are most commonly seen at the back of the throat, but may also occur on the gums, tongue, or inside of the cheeks and lips.  Some children will develop a rash on their palms and soles, and/or between their fingers and toes. This rash looks like tiny blisters underneath the skin. Children may also develop a more generalized pink rash on the rest of their body.  This illness is most commonly seen in the late spring, summer, and early fall.</p>
