			<h5>VFC Program no longer available at Children's Health Partners</h5>
			<p>The Vaccine for Children (VFC) program is a federally funded, state administered program that provides free vaccines to eligible children ages 18 and younger. In the past, some of our patients that were under-insured, meaning their medical insurance did not provide full vaccine coverage, were eligible to receive vaccines through the VFC program at our office. Effective January 1st, 2013, changes in the Illinois VFC Program are such that all under-insured children are now eligible to receive VFC vaccine only at Federally Qualified Health Centers, Rural Health Centers, or Local Public Health Departments. Please contact your county's local public health department with any questions.</p>

					Protected against Pertussis?
				</h3>
				<p>In addition to infants and kindergartners, immunization against  pertussis is also recommended for adults and adolescents who will have, or anticipate having, close contact with an infant aged <12 months. This is done with the Tdap vaccine. Tdap should ideally be administered at least two weeks before contact with the infant. Tdap can safely be given during pregnancy and is now recommended to be given with every pregnancy, preferably during the third trimester in order to provide the newborn infant with protection against pertussis during early life by antibodies passed through the placenta from mother to baby.</p>
