		<h2>2016 Flu Vaccine Clinics Now Being Scheduled</h2>
		<p>
          In order to accommodate our patients, we will be offering <a href="/health_info/influenza-vaccination.html">Flu vaccine</a> by appointment during our flu vaccine clinics held on various dates this fall.  We have three upcoming clinics: Saturday, 11/7/15, from 9am to noon; Monday, 11/9/15, from 5:30pm to 7:30pm; and Saturday, 11/14/15, from 9am to noon. At this time, all of the Flu Vaccine offered at Children's Health Partners this year is the quadrivalent vaccine, meaning that it will protect against 4 strains of influenza.  No vaccines other than the flu vaccine are given during flu vaccine clinics.  All clinics are dependent upon manufacturer release of vaccines.  Once you've scheduled your child's appointment, please make a note of the date and time as reminder calls are NOT performed the previous day due to the high volume of appointments.  Please continue to refer to the website for updates.
		</p>

		<p><strong> WELL VISITS AND FLU VACCINE:</strong> If your child has a well child check-up this fall, they can have their flu immunization at that time if the vaccine is available.</p>

		<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Children who are severely allergic to eggs should receive the flu vaccine at their allergist's office.  Those patients with egg allergy who have only experienced a mild hive-like rash after ingestion of egg and those who have previously tolerated the flu vaccine can receive the flu vaccine in our office.  Please contact our office with any questions.</p>

		<p>
		<strong>BOOSTERS:</strong>  If your child is 8 years of age or younger and it is his or her first time getting the Flu vaccine, they will need a second dose 4 weeks after the first dose.
