		<h2>Flu Vaccine Clinics for 2012-2013</h2>
		<p>
		In order to accommodate our patients, we will be offering <a href="/health_info/influenza-vaccination.html">Flu vaccine</a> by appointment during our flu vaccine clinics held on various dates this fall.  Those who meet the criteria for high risk by the CDC will be scheduled for our first 2 clinics.  FluMist, a nasal flu vaccine, is available for non-high risk children 2 years of age and older.  Please tell the scheduler which you prefer for your child when booking your appointment.  Only flu shots or Flumist Nasal Spray will be administered at flu clinics.  All clinics are dependent upon manufacturer release of vaccines.  Once you've scheduled your child's appointment, please make a note of the date and time as reminder calls are NOT performeded the previous day due to the high volume of appointments.  Please continue to refer to the website for updates.
