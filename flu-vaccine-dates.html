		<p>At this time, all of the Flu Vaccine offered at Children's Health Partners this year is the quadrivalent vaccine, 
			meaning that it will protect against 4 strains of influenza.  No vaccines other than the flu vaccine are 
			given during flu vaccine clinics.  All clinics are dependent upon manufacturer release of vaccines.  
			Once you've scheduled your child's appointment, please make a note of the date and time as reminder calls are 
			NOT performed the previous day due to the high volume of appointments.  Please continue to refer to the website for updates.</p>

		<h5>WELL VISITS AND FLU VACCINE</h5>
		<p>If your child has a well child check-up this fall, they can have their flu immunization at that time if the vaccine is available.</p>

		<h5>NOTE</h5>
		<p>Children who are severely allergic to eggs should receive the flu vaccine at their allergist's office.  Those patients with egg allergy who have only experienced a mild hive-like rash after ingestion of egg and those who have previously tolerated the flu vaccine can receive the flu vaccine in our office.  Please contact our office with any questions.</p>

		<h5>BOOSTERS</h5>
		<p>If your child is 8 years of age or younger and it is his or her first time getting the Flu vaccine, they will need a second dose 4 weeks after the first dose.
		</p>

		<h5>RESTRICTIONS</h5>
		<p>No child will be vaccinated without a scheduled appointment.  Flu clinics do not allow time to discuss medical concerns about your child.  Please call the office during regular office hours to speak to a nurse or doctor or to receive any other vaccines.
		</p>

		<p>Please call <strong>(630) 848-1700</strong> to schedule an appointment.</p>
