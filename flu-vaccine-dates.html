		<h2>Flu Vaccine Clinics Now Being Scheduled</h2>
		<p>
		In order to accommodate our patients, we will be offering <a href="/health_info/influenza-vaccination.html">Flu vaccine</a> by appointment during our flu vaccine clinics held on various dates this fall.  Our first two clinics on October 3rd and 7th will be for <a href="/health_info/influenza-vaccination.html">high-risk patients</a> only.  We will release additional dates in the upcoming couple weeks.  At these clinics, FluMist, a nasal flu vaccine, will be available for non-high risk children 2 years of age and older.  Only Flu shots or Flumist Nasal Spray will be administered at flu clinics.  All clinics are dependent upon manufacturer release of vaccines.  Once you've scheduled your child's appointment, please make a note of the date and time as reminder calls are NOT performed the previous day due to the high volume of appointments.  Please continue to refer to the website for updates.
		</p>

		<p><strong> WELL VISITS AND FLU VACCINE:</strong> If your child has a well child check-up this fall, they can have their flu immunization at that time if the vaccine is available.</p>

		<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Children who are severely allergic to eggs should NOT receive the flu vaccine.  Please contact our office with any questions.</p>

		<p>
		<strong>BOOSTERS:</strong>  If your child is 8 years of age or younger and it is his or her first time getting the Flu vaccine, they will need a second dose 4 weeks after the first dose.
		</p>

		<p>
		<strong>RESTRICTIONS:</strong>  No child will be vaccinated without a scheduled appointment.  Flu clinics do not allow time to discuss medical concerns about your child.  Please call the office during regular office hours to speak to a nurse or doctor or to receive any other vaccines.
		</p>

		<p>
		Please call <strong>(630) 848-1700</strong> to schedule an appointment.
