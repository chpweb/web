		<h2>Children's Health Partners' Policy Changes Effective June 1, 2017</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>The doctors of Children's Health Partners strongly believe the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Vaccinating your child may be the single most important thing we can do to help keep your child healthy.</li>
			<li>It is our responsibility to protect as many children as possible from disease.</li>
			<li>The recommended vaccines are safe.</li>
			<li>Vaccines are extremely effective at preventing serious illness and saving lives.</li>
			<li>Vaccines do not cause autism or other developmental disabilities.</li>
			<li>The safety and effectiveness of vaccination is supported by an overwhelming amount of scientific research.</li>
			<li>All children and adolescents should receive all of the recommended vaccinations according to the schedule published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Pediatrics.</li>
			<li>Vaccines are a victim of their own success. Most people have never seen a vaccine preventable disease. Because of this, some people are unaware of, or underestimate, the devastating complications of illnesses like meningitis and measles.</li>
			<li>Open dialogue between the patient's family and doctor is critical regarding concerns about vaccination.</li>
			<li>Splitting and delaying vaccinations allows children to unnecessarily go unprotected from preventable illness and death.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>We are, however, sensitive to the concerns that many parents have regarding vaccination. Since the opening 
			of our practice, the doctors of CHP have had thousands of discussions with parents with questions or concerns about vaccinations. Our goal has always been to develop long-term relationships with our patients and serve as a trusted resource where parents can feel comfortable asking any question about their child. For patients with vaccine concerns, we encourage you to show us the concerning articles or social media posts you have read about vaccination so that we may have an open and honest conversation about your fears. We also would like you to understand that we practice what we preach; all of us have vaccinated our own children according to the recommended AAP/CDC schedule. 
			This includes HPV (human papilloma virus, a.k.a. the "cervical cancer vaccine") and yearly influenza 
			vaccination.</p>

		<p>
          In order to accommodate our patients, we will be offering <a href="/health_info/influenza-vaccination.html">Flu vaccine</a> by appointment during our flu vaccine clinics held on various dates this fall.  We have three upcoming clinics: Saturday, 11/7/15, from 9am to noon; Monday, 11/9/15, from 5:30pm to 7:30pm; and Saturday, 11/14/15, from 9am to noon. At this time, all of the Flu Vaccine offered at Children's Health Partners this year is the quadrivalent vaccine, meaning that it will protect against 4 strains of influenza.  No vaccines other than the flu vaccine are given during flu vaccine clinics.  All clinics are dependent upon manufacturer release of vaccines.  Once you've scheduled your child's appointment, please make a note of the date and time as reminder calls are NOT performed the previous day due to the high volume of appointments.  Please continue to refer to the website for updates.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		<strong>RESTRICTIONS:</strong>  No child will be vaccinated without a scheduled appointment.  Flu clinics do not allow time to discuss medical concerns about your child.  Please call the office during regular office hours to speak to a nurse or doctor or to receive any other vaccines.
		</p>

		<p>Please call <strong>(630) 848-1700</strong> to schedule an appointment.</p>

		<p><strong> WELL VISITS AND FLU VACCINE:</strong> If your child has a well child check-up this fall, they can have their flu immunization at that time if the vaccine is available.</p>

		<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Children who are severely allergic to eggs should receive the flu vaccine at their allergist's office.  Those patients with egg allergy who have only experienced a mild hive-like rash after ingestion of egg and those who have previously tolerated the flu vaccine can receive the flu vaccine in our office.  Please contact our office with any questions.</p>

		<p>
		<strong>BOOSTERS:</strong>  If your child is 8 years of age or younger and it is his or her first time getting the Flu vaccine, they will need a second dose 4 weeks after the first dose.
