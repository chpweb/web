		<h2>Children's Health Partners' Vaccination Policy - Effective June 1, 2017</h2>
		<hr />
		<h4>The doctors of Children's Health Partners strongly believe the following:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Vaccinating your child may be the single most important thing we can do to help keep your child healthy.</li>
			<li>It is our responsibility to protect as many children as possible from disease.</li>
			<li>The <a href="#" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#vaccination-modal">recommended vaccines</a> are safe.</li>
			<li>Vaccines are extremely effective at preventing serious illness and saving lives.</li>
			<li>Vaccines do not cause autism or other developmental disabilities.</li>
			<li>The safety and effectiveness of vaccination is supported by an overwhelming amount of scientific research.</li>
			<li>All children and adolescents should receive all of the recommended vaccinations according to the schedule published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Pediatrics.</li>
			<li>Vaccines are a victim of their own success. Most people have never seen a vaccine preventable disease. Because of this, some people are unaware of, or underestimate, the devastating complications of illnesses like meningitis and measles.</li>
			<li>Open dialogue between the patient's family and doctor is critical regarding concerns about vaccination.</li>
			<li>Splitting and delaying vaccinations allows children to unnecessarily go unprotected from preventable illness and death.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>We are, however, sensitive to the concerns that many parents have regarding vaccination. Since the opening 
			of our practice, the doctors of CHP have had thousands of discussions with parents with questions or
			concerns about vaccinations. Our goal has always been to develop long-term relationships with our 
			patients and serve as a trusted resource where parents can feel comfortable asking any question about 
			their child. For patients with vaccine concerns, we encourage you to show us the concerning articles 
			or social media posts you have read about vaccination so that we may have an open and honest conversation
			about your fears. We also would like you to understand that we practice what we preach; all of us have
			vaccinated our own children according to the 
			<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/downloads/child/0-18yrs-combined-schedule-bw.pdf" target="_blank">
				recommended AAP/CDC schedule</a>. 
			This includes HPV (human papilloma virus, a.k.a. the "cervical cancer vaccine") and yearly influenza 
			vaccination.</p>

		<p>With this as background we are announcing the following changes to our practice policy, effective June 1, 2017.</p>
 
		<h4 class="seperator">Children’s Health Partners is no longer accepting families who do not vaccinate their children.</h4>

		<p>For our current patients who are unvaccinated or undervaccinated for the DTaP, IPV, HIB, PCV13, Hep B, MMR, 
			VZV (Chicken Pox), Tdap, or Menactra vaccines, we ask you to make an appointment with your child's physician
			to discuss vaccination. If you decide that vaccination is not an option for your family, we will have to ask
			you to find another health care provider for your child who shares your views.  We have not taken this position
			to bully or coerce families into vaccination.  We do this for three reasons:</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li>to emphasize the facts about immunization and how critical we feel vaccines are to your child’s health,</li>
			<li>to protect our patients who cannot be vaccinated (for medical reasons or because they are too young),</li>
			<li>to ensure that we are not passively supporting non-vaccination by allowing it to continue in our practice.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p>We would prefer to remain your child's pediatrician and will not dismiss any family who is actively working to vaccinate their child.</p>
 
		<h4 class="seperator">Children's Health Partners will no longer be completing the State of Illinois Certificate of Religious Exemption Forms.</h4>

		<p>If your child is unvaccinated or undervaccinated and has had a Well Child Visit at Children's Health Partners within the last year, then your
			child's school physical form and religious exemption form are good for one year from the date of their check-up. 
			However, beginning June 1, 2017, we will no longer complete any State of Illinois Certificate of Religious 
			Exemption forms associated with new Well Child Visits.</p>
 
		<h4 class="seperator">Frequently Asked Questions:</h4>
 
		<div class="well">
			<h5>What if my child has a medical reason for which they can't be vaccinated?</h5>
			<p>Sometimes children have a medical reason for not being vaccinated, i.e. they are undergoing 
				chemotherapy for cancer or are on immunosuppressants after an organ transplant. As long as 
				patients receive the vaccines that are medically indicated, they are welcome at CHP.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="well">
			<h5>What if I would like to space out my child's shots?</h5>
			<p>Spacing out immunizations leads to delays in infants being protected from preventable diseases. 
				It is not a practice that we recommend. However, CHP will continue to offer this as an 
				option, since it results in more children being immunized. We expect parents to keep their 
				children on a schedule so that they are not more than a month behind on their regular vaccines.</p>
		</div>
	
		<div class="well">
			<h5>What about HPV, influenza and Hep A?</h5>
			<p>Although we recommend all of these vaccinations and give them to our own kids, they are not 
				required by the State of Illinois, so we have not made them mandatory for remaining a patient 
				at CHP at this time. </p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="well">
			<h5>What if my child is only missing one or two shots?</h5>
			<p>We are requiring that our patients be up to date with all of the required vaccinations. These are 
				DTaP, IPV, HIB, PCV13, Hep B, MMR, VZV (Chicken Pox), Tdap, and Menactra vaccines. If you 
				have a question about your child’s immunization status, please call our office.</p>

          <p><small>**Gardasil protects against the human papilloma virus (HPV) that causes cervical cancer and genital warts, as well as many cancers of the mouth and throat.  It is a 2 shot series, starting at age 9 and older.  We routinely start the series at age 11.  The second shot is given 6-12 months after the first.</small></p>
