		<div class="content">
			<p><p>Do not give Tylenol to an infant that is less than two months old without first speaking to a physician.  If your infant is less than two months old and has a fever >100.4 degrees rectally, call our office immediately.</p>

      <p>If your child is over two months of age, you can safely give him or her acetaminophen for fever or discomfort.  Do not give Tylenol for more than 72 hours without discussing your child's condition with our office.</p>

      <p>Acetaminophen comes in a variety of forms.  Infant drops are more concentrated than children's preparations.  Therefore, for the same dose of acetaminophen, your child will receive a smaller volume of an infant preparation compared to a children's preparation.  PLEASE CHECK THE CONCENTRATION ON YOUR BOTTLE TO KNOW WHICH STRENGTH YOU ARE USING.</p>

      <p>Acetaminophen can be given safely every 4-6 hours as needed.  Do not give more than 5 doses in a 24 hour period.</p>

      <h3>Dosing chart for Acetaminophen suppositories</h3>
      <p>You will notice these doses tend to be a little higher than if given orally. This is safe for two reasons:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Suppositories are absorbed less consistently than an oral dose.</li>
        <li>Suppositories are meant for short-term use (just while your child can't tolerate oral intake) and giving a little higher dose for one day will not be harmful.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>Doses are every 4-6 hours</p>
