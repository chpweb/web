			<p><p>For protection against mosquitoes, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends using one of three different types of insect repellants for children older than 2 months.</p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Repellants containing DEET</strong>:<br/><br/>
          <ul>
            <li>The repellants should contain between 10% and 30% DEET.  The greater the concentration, the longer the protection lasts.  For example, 24% DEET lasts about 5 hours.</li>
            <li>Ideally, dress your child in long sleeves and pants, and then spray the clothing with the repellant.  If there is exposed skin, spray the clothing and the exposed skin, avoiding the hands and eyes.</li>
            <li>Do not cover the skin that has been sprayed under clothing.</li>
            <li>Wash clothing in hot water and bathe your child with soap upon returning home to minimize contact with DEET.</li>
            <li>Do not spray directly on the face.  Apply to your hands and then rub onto your child's face, avoiding his mouth and eyes.</li>
            <li>Do not apply to children's hands since they may put them in their mouth.</li>
            <li>Pregnant women can safely use DEET-containing repellant.</li>
            <li>No serious illness has resulted from using DEET-containing repellant.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Repellants containing eucalyptus oils</strong>:<br/><br/>
          <ul>
            <li>These types of repellants usually last less than 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Allergic reactions can occur, but are rare.</li>
            <li>These repellants should not be used on children under 3 years old.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Repellants containing Permethrin</strong>:<br/><br/>
          <ul>
            <li>These repellents kill ticks on contact.</li>
            <li>When applied to clothing, it will last even with several washings.</li>
            <li>Pemethrin repellants should  be applied only to clothing or outdoor equipment such as sleeping bags or tents.</li>
            <li>Permethrin-containing repellants should NOT be applied directly to skin.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>Never use any repellant on broken or irritated skin.</p>

      <p>If your child develops a rash or shows any signs of an allergic reaction, stop using, wash the repellant off with mild soap and water, and call your local poison control center or doctor's office.</p>

      <p>For infants less than 2 months, use tight fitting mosquito net over stroller, and try to avoid having your infant outside unprotected when mosquitoes are abundant.</p></p>
