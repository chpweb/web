		<h2>Iron is Important</h2>
		<hr />
		<div class="content">
		<p>Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency.  Its prevalence is highest among young children and women of childbearing age.  In fact, evidence suggests that up to 50% of 1-2 year old children may not be getting enough iron.  Iron depletion causes anemia.  Prior to anemia, low iron stores can result in developmental delays and behavioral disturbances.  These delays may persist past school age if the deficiency is not fully reversed. Therefore, it is very important that infants and children receive adequate dietary iron.</p>

      <h3>Facts about iron</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The absorption of iron can vary from 1-50%, mainly dependent on the amount of iron already stored in the body.</li>
        <li>Heme iron, which is found only in meat, poultry, and fish, is 2-3 times more absorbable than non-heme iron (that found in plant based foods and iron fortified foods).</li>
        <li>Heme iron and vitamin C enhance the absorption of non-heme iron, so try and eat the two sources at the same meal.</li>
        <li>Calcium and tannins (in teas) decrease iron absorption, and are ideally consumed at another time.</li>
        <li>Infants acquire irons stores late in pregnancy. A full term infant has adequate iron stores for 4-6 months.  Low birth weight and premature infants have decreased iron stores and are at increased risk for iron deficiency.</li>
        <li>Exclusively breast-fed infants and infants fed iron fortified formula rarely become iron deficient.</li>
        <li>Studies have shown that iron fortified formulas caused no more gastrointestinal distress (i.e. gas, constipation, or pain) than non fortified formulas.  There is NO reason to give an infant low iron formula!</li>
        <li>Adolescent females with heavy menstrual blood loss are also at risk for iron deficiency and anemia.</li>
        <li>Iron is very dangerous or even deadly in overdose.  Make sure all iron supplements are kept securely away from children.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What you can do to ensure your child gets enough iron</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Children >1 year and adolescent males need 10 mg of iron per day.  Adolescent females need 18 mg of iron per day.</li>
        <li>Give infants only breast milk or iron-fortified formula for the first 4-6 months of life.</li>
        <li>When solids are introduced, give iron fortified baby cereal.  Two servings (1/2-1 ounce per serving) of iron-fortified cereal per day will help prevent iron deficiency in your infant.  Feeding the cereal at the same time as fruits and vegetables with vitamin C will help iron absorption.</li>
        <li>Do not give more than 4-6 ounces of cow's milk or soy milk per day prior to one year of age.</li>
        <li>Add pureed meats to your infant's diet after 6 months of age.</li>
        <li>Educate yourself about iron-rich foods (see attached list).  It can be difficult to get 10 mg of iron per day in your child's diet, especially if they are picky and eat small portions like most toddlers.  Read labels.  Many breakfast cereals are iron-fortified.  If you feel that your child is not getting enough iron, try giving them a multivitamin with iron each day.  If they are too young for chewable vitamins, they can have one dropper of a liquid multivitamin with iron (Poly-Vi-Sol with Iron). Try mixing the vitamin in a small amount of juice to improve the taste and enhance absorption.</li>
        <li>Discuss screening for anemia with your doctor if you are concerned that your child has not been eating enough iron.</li>
