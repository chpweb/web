			<h3>What is pertussis?</h3>

      <p>Pertussis (whooping cough) is a highly contagious bacterial disease that can be fatal for infants. It creates sticky, thick mucus in the airways that makes it hard to breathe, eat, and drink. Pertussis is also known as whooping cough because people with the disease often make a loud "whoop" sound as they struggle to breathe through their narrowed airways between coughing spasms. Complications of pertussis, which are most common in infants aged 12 months and younger, include apnea (pauses in breathing), pneumonia, dehydration, seizures, and death.</p>

      <h3>Pertussis is still a problem.</h3>

      <p>Pertussis occurs in waves with peaks every 3-5 years. Pertussis rates have been higher in many areas throughout the country in recent years. In 2010, there were over 27,000 reported cases of pertussis in the United States with 27 deaths, 25 of which were infants.  After decreased disease activity in 2011, provisional data collected by January 2013 indicated that over 41,000 cases of pertussis were reported to the CDC in 2012 with 18 pertussis-related deaths.</p>

      <h3>Your baby may be vulnerable.</h3>

      <p>While infants are given routine diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis (DTaP) immunizations, they do not begin the primary series until they are 2 months of age and may not be fully protected until they receive their third or fourth dose at 6-15 months. During this time, they may be vulnerable to pertussis.</p>

      <h3>You could have pertussis and not know it.</h3>

      <p>When an adult or older child contracts pertussis, symptoms can be very mild and may resemble a common cold. As a result, many cases go undiagnosed, increasing the risk that someone - even you - could unknowingly expose your baby to pertussis.</p>

      <h3>Everyone 11-64 years of age should get vaccinated.</h3>

      <p>You and other members of your family may have been vaccinated against pertussis as children. Children currently receive a DTaP vaccine as part of their kindergarten vaccines.  But this vaccine loses its ability to protect after 5-10 years, leaving you vulnerable to contract and transmit the disease. In 2005, vaccination against pertussis with Tdap (brand name "Adacel") became available for people over the age of 7 years.  This vaccine is now required for all Illinois students as they enter the 6th grade.  Additionally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends a pertussis booster for everyone 11-64 years of age.</p>

      <h3>Make sure your family and friends get vaccinated.</h3>

      <p>Studies show that cases of infant pertussis come from the family more often than from anywhere else. In fact, anyone who spends time with your baby may pass on pertussis. This includes childcare providers, household help, and your friends. To help protect your baby from pertussis, make sure anyone who comes into close contact with your baby gets vaccinated.</p>

      <p>Immunization with Tdap (Tetanus, Diphtheria, Pertussis) is particularly recommended for all adults and adolescents who will have, or anticipate having, close contact with an infant aged <12 months. Tdap should be administered at least two weeks before contact with the infant. This vaccine is safe to receive during pregnancy and, as of February 2013, is recommended to be given with every pregnancy, preferably during the third trimester in order to provide the newborn infant with protection against pertussis during early life by antibodies passed through the placenta from mother to baby. For women not vaccinated during pregnancy, Tdap should be given immediately in the postpartum period. It is safe to get while breastfeeding and is compatible with other vaccines that may be needed at the same time, such as a rubella vaccine or flu shot.  Please discuss immunization with Tdap with your obstetrician. If needed, Tdap is available and can be given in the hospital.</p>
