			<p><h3>What is pertussis?</h3>

      <p>Pertussis (whooping cough) is a highly contagious bacterial disease that can be fatal for infants. It creates sticky, thick mucus in the airways that makes it hard to breathe, eat, and drink. Pertussis is also known as whooping cough because people with the disease often make a loud "whoop" sound as they struggle to breathe through their narrowed airways between coughing spasms. Complications of pertussis, which are most common in infants aged 12 months and younger, include apnea (pauses in breathing), pneumonia, dehydration, seizures, and death.</p>

      <h3>Pertussis is still a problem.</h3>

      <p>In 2006, over 15,000 cases of pertussis were reported in the United States. 140 infants died of pertussis in the United States between 2000-2005, 126 of which were under 4 months old.</p>

      <h3>Your baby may be vulnerable.</h3>

      <p>While infants are given routine diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis (DTaP) immunizations, they do not begin the primary series until they are 2 months of age and may not be fully protected until they receive their third or fourth dose at 6-15 months. During this time, they may be vulnerable to pertussis.</p>

      <h3>You could have pertussis and not know it.</h3>

      <p>When an adult or older child contracts pertussis, symptoms can be very mild and may resemble a common cold. As a result, many cases go undiagnosed, increasing the risk that someone - even you - could unknowingly expose your baby to pertussis.</p>

      <h3>Everyone 11-64 years of age should get vaccinated.</h3>

      <p>You and other members of your family may have been vaccinated against pertussis as children. Children currently receive a DTaP vaccine as part of their kindergarten vaccines.  But this vaccine loses its ability to protect after 5-10 years, leaving you vulnerable to contract and transmit the disease. Until recently, there was no vaccine available for people over the age of 7 years.  But now that there is a vaccine available (Tdap -- brand name "Adacel") for older children and adults.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends a pertussis booster for everyone 11-64 years of age.</p>

      <h3>Make sure your family and friends get vaccinated.</h3>

      <p>Studies show that cases of infant pertussis come from the family more often than from anywhere else. In fact, anyone who spends time with your baby may pass on pertussis. This includes childcare providers, household help, and your friends. To help protect your baby from pertussis, make sure anyone who comes into close contact with your baby gets vaccinated.</p>

      <p>Immunization with Tdap (Tetanus, Diphtheria, Pertussis) is particularly recommended for non-pregnant adults and adolescents who will have, or anticipate having, close contact with an infant aged <12 months. Tdap should be administered at least two weeks before contact with the infant. For such patients, the interval between Td and Tdap may be as short as two years, and sometimes shorter.  If you have just given birth, we, along with the CDC and AAP, recommend getting a Tdap vaccine as soon as possible.  It is safe to get while breastfeeding and is compatible with other vaccines that may be needed at the same time, such as a rubella vaccine or flu shot.  Ask your obstetrician if they can order it in the hospital!</p></p>
