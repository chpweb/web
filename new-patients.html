        <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-9">
          <div class="well">
            <h5><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-question-sign"></i> Is Children's Health Partners (CHP) taking new patients?</h5>
            <p>Yes, Children's Health Partners is currently accepting new patients.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="well">
            <h5><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-question-sign"></i> Do I need to register with CHP before my child is born?</h5>
            <p>No, however it is appropriate for parents to call the office and verify that the practice is still taking new patients and that CHP accepts the patient's insurance. The parents of newborns should also notify the hospital as to who their pediatrician
              will be during the pre-registration process.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="well">
            <h5 id="pre-natal"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-question-sign"></i> Do the doctors schedule pre-natal interviews?</h5>
            <p>No, due to the large number of current patients who need to be seen by the physicians, we no longer schedule pre-natal interviews. However, pre-natal classes taught by one of the doctors are now being offered periodically to introduce expectant
              families to the practice and review common issues surrounding newborn care. Please call our office to find out when the next class will be offered. In addition, potential patients are encouraged to call the office for practice information
              and to ask whatever additional questions that they may have.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="well">
            <h5><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-question-sign"></i> How many doctors are in the practice?</h5>
            <p>We have 6 doctors in our practice: Karen Kreiling, Laurel George, Michelle Pierce, Brooke Scherer, Janie Canner, and Radhika Shah. (For more information about the physicians, please see the <a href="/doctors">Our Doctors</a> section of this
              website.)</p>
          </div>

          <div class="well">
            <h5><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-question-sign"></i> Will my child be assigned to one doctor?</h5>
            <p>No, the doctors do not divide the patients in the practice by physician. In fact, we suggest that you meet all the doctors during your first several visits, schedule permitting. If you would like to schedule a well child check-up with a particular
              physician subsequent to your childâ€™s first few visits, we will try to honor those requests as the schedule allows. However, if your child is sick, he or she will see the first available physician.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="well">
            <h5><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-question-sign"></i> How do I let the hospital know who my child's pediatrician is? </h5>
            <p>When you pre-register at Edward Hospital you will be asked to list your pediatrician. You may list any of our doctors and when your child is born, Edward Hospital will notify us. The rounding physician will come by to see your baby within
              24 hours of birth. A doctor from the practice will then see your newborn each morning until you are discharged home. On the day of discharge, the physician will tell you when to bring your newborn in for his or her first office appointment.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="well">
            <h5><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-question-sign"></i> What if my baby is not being delivered at Edward Hospital?</h5>
            <p>If your baby is not being delivered at Edward Hospital, you should request that your baby be seen by the on-staff pediatrician at the hospital where you deliver. When you are discharged, you should call our office to schedule your first appointment.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="well">
            <h5><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-question-sign"></i> Are the pediatricians at CHP supportive of breastfeeding?</h5>
            <p>The doctors are extremely supportive of breastfeeding. Both the physicians and nurses have extensive experience in supporting nursing mothers.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="well">
            <h5><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-question-sign"></i> Do the pediatricians advocate regular immunizations for children?</h5>
            <p>The doctors follow the American Academy of Pediatrics and Center for Disease Control guidelines for childhood immunizations. The pediatricians feel that childhood immunizations are crucial in maintaining the health of children. Effective June 1st, 2017,
              Children's Health Partners will not accept new families who do not plan to vaccinate their children.  Please refer to our <a href="/vaccine-policy.html">vaccination policy</a> for full details.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="well">
            <h5><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-question-sign"></i> What are your office hours?</h5>
            <p>Daily office hours are listed under the <a href="/office-information">office hours section</a> of this website. Please note that patients are seen by appointment only and parents should call and set up an appointment before bringing a child
              to the office for treatment. Also, Saturday appointments are scheduled sequentially and are for acutely ill patients only.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="well">
            <h5><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-question-sign"></i> Can I contact a physician after office hours?</h5>
            <p>After regular office hours there is always a pediatrician on call. If your child has an illness or issue that cannot wait until the next business day, you should call the office (630-848-1700) and choose the option for the "pediatrician on
              call." Leave a message, with your child's name, date of birth and the phone number where you can be reached, and your call will be returned as soon as possible. If you have not heard from the physician within one hour, please call again.
              Many common questions that arise after hours can be answered by referring to the <a href="/health-information">health information section</a> of this website.</p>
