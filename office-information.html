          <h4>After Hours Physician</h4>
          <p>One of the Children's Health Partners pediatricians is always accessible after the office closes through our paging system if your child has an urgent medical issue.</p>
          <p>
            To access the paging system:
            <br/>
            <br/> Call our main number <strong>(630-848-1700)</strong>
            <br/>
            <br/> Follow the directions to page the pediatrician on call. Leave a brief message, clearly stating and spelling the patient's first and last name and phone number with area code. If you have not heard back from the physician within one hour,
            please page again. Occasionally, the page does not go through, the message is not clear, or the parent forgets to leave a telephone number.
